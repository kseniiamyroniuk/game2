# Project Roadmap for Cursor Integration

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the steps to build and integrate the project into Cursor while avoiding "tutorial hell." The project focuses on developing a game-based corrective session.

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Research
- **Understand the Project Goals**
  - Define the purpose and expected outcomes of the game.
  - Identify target audience and user needs.
- **Concept Design**
  - Draft initial game flow and user interaction.
  - Research Cursor documentation and integration techniques.

---

## Phase 2: Design
- **Wireframes and Mockups**
  - Create wireframes for the game interface.
  - Develop mockups for key screens using tools like Figma.
- **Cursor-Specific Features**
  - Plan how Cursor-specific features will enhance the user experience.
  - Design components to leverage Cursor's capabilities (e.g., collaborative editing).

---

## Phase 3: Development
- **Environment Setup**
  - Set up the development environment with Cursor compatibility.
  - Install necessary dependencies and extensions for Cursor.
- **Core Game Logic**
  - Implement game mechanics using JavaScript and integrate with Cursor APIs.
  - Develop rules and scoring system.
- **User Interface (UI)**
  - Build and integrate Cursor-compatible UI components.
  - Add animations and transitions.

---

## Phase 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing**
  - Test individual components and features within Cursor.
- **Integration Testing**
  - Ensure seamless integration with Cursor's collaborative features.
- **User Testing**
  - Conduct sessions with users to gather feedback.
  - Identify and resolve bugs or usability issues.

---

## Phase 5: Refinement
- **Optimize Performance**
  - Enhance performance for smooth operation in Cursor.
- **Polish Visuals**
  - Refine visual assets and animations.
- **Enhance User Experience**
  - Address feedback to improve the game flow and Cursor interaction.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment
- **Package and Distribute**
  - Prepare the project for deployment within Cursor.
  - Publish and test on Cursor-supported platforms.
- **Post-Launch Monitoring**
  - Monitor user engagement and feedback.
  - Plan updates and improvements based on user input.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Design**: Figma, Adobe Photoshop
- **Development**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Cursor APIs
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress
- **Deployment**: Cursor-compatible hosting (e.g., Render, Heroku)
